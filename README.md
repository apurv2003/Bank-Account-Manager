The Bank Account Manager project simulates fundamental banking operations through a console-based application. Users can create accounts, deposit funds, withdraw funds, and check balances. The program manages multiple accounts by storing data securely and maintains transaction histories for each account. It ensures transaction security by validating operations such as sufficient funds for withdrawals and valid account numbers for transfers. Error handling is crucial to handle scenarios like invalid inputs or insufficient funds gracefully, preventing crashes and maintaining data integrity.
